ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Agent-Based Modeling Study Group!

We are a study group based at the University of SÃ£o Paulo ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)), dedicated to exploring and applying Agent-Based Models ([ABMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model)) as tools for understanding complex systems in a variety of scientific fields.

Our work is guided by three core principles:

- [**Low Threshold, No Ceiling**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/2004/netlogo-swarmfest2004.pdf): We believe the group should be welcoming and accessible to beginners, without limiting how far experts can explore and contribute.
- **Interdisciplinarity**: We believe that combining insights from different fields is essential to enrich how we discuss and apply ABMs.
- **Horizontality**: We believe in self-managing as a group and producing clear, accessible content that avoids unnecessary jargon or barriers, while maintaining strong scientific rigor.

[Join us](https://github.com/orgs/abmstudygroup/discussions/2) in exploring ABMs and their role in understanding and addressing complex challenges.
