ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Agent-Based Modeling Study Group!

We are a study group based at the University of SÃ£o Paulo ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)), dedicated to exploring and applying Agent-Based Models (ABMs) as tools for understanding complex systems in a variety of scientific fields.

Our work is guided by three core principles:

- [**Low Threshold, No Ceiling**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/2004/netlogo-swarmfest2004.pdf): We believe the group should be welcoming and accessible to beginners, without limiting how far experts can explore and contribute.
- **Interdisciplinarity**: We believe that combining insights from different fields is essential to enrich how we discuss and apply ABMs.
- **Horizontality**: We believe in self-managing as a group and producing clear, accessible content that avoids unnecessary jargon or barriers, while maintaining strong scientific rigor.

Join us in exploring ABMs and their role in understanding and addressing complex challenges.
